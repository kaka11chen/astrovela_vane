# Development

Vane contains Python, pybind11, and a modified DuckDB C++ engine. A native build also links Arrow Flight, gRPC, and selected DuckDB extensions.

## Prerequisites

- Linux x86-64 for the currently tested path
- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12; Python 3.12 is recommended and is the primary development version
- Git with submodule support
- A C++17 compiler, CMake 3.29+, Ninja, and ccache
- vcpkg at the baseline pinned in `vcpkg.json`

Initialize the engine fork:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Bootstrap native dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_vcpkg.sh
```

The helper checks out the exact baseline from `vcpkg.json`, installs into
`vcpkg_installed`, and verifies the committed native-dependency license bundle.
When intentionally changing native dependencies, regenerate the bundle with
`python scripts/sync_vcpkg_licenses.py` and review its diff.

## Incremental package build

Create and activate a virtual environment, then reuse a persistent native build directory:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

export SKBUILD_BUILD_DIR="$PWD/build/python-release"
export SKBUILD_CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
python -m pip install . --no-build-isolation -v
```

Do not use `pip install -e`. An editable install can cause Ray workers to invoke the build backend during import and delay actor startup.

Python-only changes do not require a native rebuild. Changes below `src/duckdb_py/` or `external/duckdb/src/` do.

## DuckDB engine-only build

For a fast C++ compile check:

```bash
cmake -S external/duckdb -B external/duckdb/build -G Ninja
cmake --build external/duckdb/build --parallel
```

Run a named engine test or the full unit suite:

```bash
external/duckdb/build/test/unittest "test name" -s
external/duckdb/build/test/unittest
```

## Python tests

The required release gate covers the supported base installation and does not
need model downloads, cloud credentials, GPUs, or external services:

```bash
scripts/run_release_tests.sh
```

The inherited compatibility suites are broader and require the development
dependency group. Run them when changing the corresponding integration:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/fast
python -m pytest tests/slow
python -m pytest tests/ai
```

Some tests require network access, model weights, GPUs, credentials, or a local MinIO/Ray setup. Tests must skip with a clear reason when an optional environment is absent; they must not silently use a maintainer's local endpoint or credentials.

## Formatting and static checks

```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
scripts/format root --changed
pre-commit run --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD
```

The root formatter deliberately excludes `external/duckdb`. Format submodule changes with:

```bash
scripts/format submodule --changed
```

## Debugging Ray workers

Set `DUCKDB_DISTRIBUTED_DEBUG=1`. Native debug output uses `DistributedDebugStream()` and appears in Ray worker error logs, normally below `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/worker-*.err`. Plain C `stdout` output is not reliably captured by Ray workers.

## Release artifacts

Build and validate an sdist before opening a release pull request:

```bash
python -m build --sdist
python scripts/check_release_artifacts.py dist/*.tar.gz
```

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the complete process.
